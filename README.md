# Blufy - React Music Player

A javascript music player project I built and took inspiration from spotify. Has all the functionality of a music player with additional features to make it unique. 

## Features

- Basic music player functionalities (Play, skip, volume, shuffle etc.. )
- Library of music track you add
- Lyrics/karaoke mode - If lrc file (lyrics file format) is provided with a music track
- Adjust Playback speed ranging from 2x to 0.25x speed
- Default album cover is used if music track has no image cover
- Responsive audio timeframe slider (synced with lyrics)
